# Site
This is a simple node.js app with express routing and static pages. 
It represents a personal site and has information about my personal background, some of my experience, contact details, and a contact form.
Ajax was used to make a call to the server from the client side and nodemailer to format an email, otherwise the site is html with minor css styling and javascript.
