# Site
This is a simple node.js app with express routing and static pages. 
It is used as a personal site (https://tikaharikhanal.com/) and has some information about my personal background, experience, contact details, and a contact form.
Ajax was used to make a call to the server from the client side and nodemailer to format an email, otherwise the site consists of html pages with minor css styling and javascript.
